# 🍷 Wine Industry Trends Analysis

A Data Analytics & Web Scraping Project
By Vaibhav Umbarkar


# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global wine industry trends using web-scraped data. The goal was to understand wine popularity, pricing behavior, grape variety patterns, and revenue distribution across different countries.

The dataset was collected by scraping product details such as:
Product Name
Vintage Year
Grape Type
Price
Reviews
Country
Quantity & Total Amount
The analysis includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate insights that highlight global wine patterns.



# 🎯 Project Objectives

Identify the most popular and high-demand wine varieties

Compare price variations across countries, grape types, and vintages

Analyze customer review patterns to understand preferences

Evaluate sales performance and find top revenue-generating regions

# 📦 Data Collection (Web Scraping)
Using BeautifulSoup, data was scraped from wine product containers containing:

Product name
Short description
Grape type
Country
Price per bottle
Number of bottles
Reviews
Total amount
This allowed building a structured dataset for in-depth analysis.



# 🧹 Data Cleaning

Performed the following steps:

Handling missing values

Extracting numerical values from text

Standardizing column formats

Converting price, quantity, and year into usable numeric formats

Creating new calculated fields like total_amount



# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**🔹 Univariate Analysis**

USA, France, and Italy are the top wine-producing countries

Cabernet Sauvignon is the most frequently used grape variety



**🔹 Bivariate Analysis**

United Kingdom has the highest average wine price

Older vintages (2000–2009) show much higher pricing

Chardonnay-based blends are among the most premium




**🔹 Multivariate Analysis**

UK leads in highest-priced grape–country combinations

France dominates total yearly revenue, especially recent vintages




# 💡 Key Insights

Europe (France, Italy, Spain) dominates in premium pricing, quality, and global demand.

Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay-based blends remain highly popular.

Price significantly increases for aged vintages.

France recorded the highest sales revenue in the dataset.



# 🏁 Conclusion

This project reveals how geography, grape type, and vintage year influence wine pricing and customer demand.
The analysis can help wine distributors, retailers, and marketers make data-driven decisions in product pricing, sourcing, and inventory management.




# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add machine learning models for price prediction

Automate web scraping with pagination + scheduler

Build an interactive Power BI / Streamlit dashboard

Perform sentiment analysis on reviews
